[Live Deployment](https://esarnb.github.io/Portfolio/) for you to check out.
## Getting Started

The Portfolio is only a single page. In the nav on the top right, there are anchors that lead to parts of the portfolio, scrolling to them.

You will need all of the files in this repository (except git images) for it all to work properly.

----

## Prerequisites

You MUST have an internet connection to load Materialize CDNs. You may install them individually if needed for offline mode.

If you are running it on a server, a preferred apache2, nginx, or express webserver is required to host the html files.


## Installing

To run on both localhost pc server or a remote server, download all folders and files, exluding the git images folder. Once all of these are in a single dedicated folder, you are all set.


## Deployment
If hosting on a remote server, placing the html files and folders in your web directory is the only step required. 

If local, open the index.html file with your preferred browser. That's all there is to it!
